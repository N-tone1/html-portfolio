  Hello, I'm Anton Kolnrekaj, a passionate individual with a diverse background. I have over 20 years of invaluable work experience, primarily as the founder and owner of a successful bakery business. Beyond my entrepreneurial spirit, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in technology.
  
  In addition to my professional endeavors, I have a deep-rooted passion for sports and was a former athlete. This unique blend of experiences has shaped me into a well-rounded individual, capable of adapting to different challenges and thriving in a variety of environments.
  
  I'm excited to leverage my skills, knowledge, and enthusiasm as I continue my journey of personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>My passion for technology has been unwavering, and I've always sought independence from the confines of physical workspaces. This drive has led me to make a career transition, where I'm focused on acquiring expertise in the English language and exploring remote work opportunities.</p>

<p>By embracing this new path, my goal is not only to gain proficiency in English but also to unlock more time for personal and societal growth. I'm excited about the possibilities this change will bring and the chance to integrate my tech background into this exciting new journey.</p>
